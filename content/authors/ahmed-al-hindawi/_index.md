I am a Critical Care trainee. My clinical training involved anaesthesia where I did my core anaesthetics training in KSS followed by a Research Fellowship at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital. There, I started a PhD in Collaboration with Imperial College London looking at delirium in ICU where I was awarded the J Moulton Prize for Research into Mental Health through Clinical Trials I am the Principal Investigator for CONfuSED, a clinical feasibilty study looking into the role of eye tracking for the prediction and diagnosis of delirium.

In 2021, I joined Harris-Labs as an Academic Researcher and as an NIHR Academic Fellow.
